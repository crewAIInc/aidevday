# Real AI Agents in Action: Automate, Adapt, and Scale

## Overview

AI is more than just automation — it's about building intelligent systems that create real impact.
As engineers, we're here to build AI that actually works in production, drives efficiency, and unlocks new possibilities for businesses and careers.

This is a hands-on, code-first workshop where you'll build real AI agents that go beyond simple scripts and prompts. You'll see how to create agents that think, collaborate, and scale, using the latest advancements in AI automation.

## What You'll Learn

In 90 minutes, you'll:
- Code AI agents that automate and adapt dynamically
- Learn best practices for making them production-ready
- Leave with a working AI agent—and insights you can immediately apply

By the end, you won't just understand AI agents—you'll have built a few and be ready to bring those skills into your day-to-day work.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python experience (if you've written scripts, you're good)
- Laptop with Python 3.10+ installed
- GitHub account (for cloning workshop code)
- Bonus: Familiarity with APIs and basic LLM concepts will be helpful but not required—we'll guide you through everything step by step

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SC-CrewAI-Conference2025.git
   cd SC-CrewAI-Conference2025
   ```

2. Set up your environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your API keys
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your API keys (we'll provide details during the workshop)

## Workshop Structure

This repository is organized into modules that build on each other:

- **Module 1**: Introduction to AI Agents and CrewAI
- **Module 2**: Building Your First Agent
- **Module 3**: Creating Multi-Agent Systems
- **Module 4**: Making Agents Production-Ready

Each module contains the code examples and exercises we'll work through together.
