# Installation

## Getting Started with CrewAI

To help users quickly set up and run their first CrewAI instance, follow these steps to install CrewAI and its dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a basic understanding of Python. CrewAI requires **Python >=3.10 and <3.13**. To check your Python version, run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you need to update Python, visit [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads).

### Step 1: Install `uv`

CrewAI utilizes `uv` for dependency and package management. If `uv` is not installed, you can install it using the following commands:

- **On macOS/Linux:**
  
  Use `curl`:

  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

  If `curl` is not available, you can use `wget`:

  ```bash
  wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

- **On Windows:**

  Execute the following in PowerShell:

  ```bash
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

Refer to [UV's installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if you encounter any issues.

### Step 2: Install CrewAI

Once `uv` is installed, run the following command to install the `crewai` CLI:

```bash
uv tool install crewai
```

If you receive a `PATH` warning, you can resolve it by running:

```bash
uv tool update-shell
```

To confirm that CrewAI has been successfully installed, list your tools:

```bash
uv tools list
```

You should see `crewai` listed, indicating a successful installation. Now you're ready to create your first AI crew!

### Creating a CrewAI Project

To efficiently structure your agents and tasks, it's recommended to use the `YAML` template scaffolding. To start:

1. Generate project scaffolding by running:

    ```bash
    crewai create crew <your_project_name>
    ```

   This will create a new project with the following structure:

   ```
   my_project/
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── knowledge/
   ├── pyproject.toml
   ├── README.md
   ├── .env
   └── src/
       └── my_project/
           ├── __init__.py
           ├── main.py
           ├── crew.py
           ├── tools/
           │   ├── custom_tool.py
           │   └── __init__.py
           └── config/
               ├── agents.yaml
               └── tasks.yaml
   ```

2. Customize your project by editing `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` to define agent behaviors and workflows. Keep sensitive information like API keys in the `.env`.

3. Before running your crew, ensure everything is set up by executing:

   ```bash
   crewai install
   ```

   To add any additional packages, use:

   ```bash
   uv add <package-name>
   ```

4. Finally, run your crew with:

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```
